# Community.CSharp.Sqlite 

This is a Community.Csharp.Sqlite (csharp-sqlite) fork with some additions, most notably `SqliteDatabase`.

## SqliteDatabase

An addition to the library to make certain very common operations easier/more convenient.

## Compiling

This project compiles in Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.6.7)  under "Any CPU" configuration.

## Provenance

The original project by Noah B. Hart can still be found at https://code.google.com/archive/p/csharp-sqlite, but apparently not for much longer. Since the status of the original project is unknown at this time, it is prudent to take precautions to preserve it for posterity.

This fork was created from https://github.com/ericschultz/csharp-sqlite clone by Eric Schultz. Why this clone and not the original source on Google Code? Because it is easier to fork within GitHub and Eric's version works just fine.
